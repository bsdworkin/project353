        <p class="lead">Lym Photography custom portrait sessions are designed for you and your family:</p>
        <p> I am available to meet at a park, your home, your favorite ice cream shop, or anywhere else that is meaningful to you or your family. Each session begins with a consultation to make sure that the session is unique to you and your family and reflects the best of your family’s personality. We will then have fun together until we have at least 50 edited, high-resolution images for you to view in a private online gallery.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="lead">Life is beautiful, and I want to capture in photographs the beautiful moments of our life</p>
        <p>I am the official photographer for the 2013 and 2014 Pittsburgh International Children’s Festivals. My photos were displayed in the Oh Snap! exhibit at the Carnegie Museum of Art in 2013, and at the Instagram Show at the Melrose Lightspace in California in 2014. I am a life lover and a loud laugher. I love origami and DIY projects such as scrapbooking. I like drawing. I received an honorable mention from Children’s Pictorial when I was four years old. But, after that, my drawing level didn’t improve a lot. I play some instruments like Erhu and piano, but I can play only simple tunes. I love flowers; I can spend the whole day hanging around in the garden. I love to eat and to cook delicious food (that’s why losing weight is my endless job). I am addicted to beautiful dinnerware and all kinds of cups, Anthropologie, and all kinds of antique stores are my favorite places.</p>
